Welcome to the WorldBrain project and great that you are also interested in improving the quality of humanity's greatest invention, the internet. :tada: :+1:

Together we want to work on the goal of **Increased (scientific) literacy in our global society through a better information quality on the internet.**

<br>
## Long term vision of the WorldBrain project

As the WorldBrain project, we aim to develop a browser plugin to see if an article or blog post you read is trustworthy, based on how well it represents scientifically verifiable facts and to surface the most accurate content on the web. 
Our work will be the research and development ways to make verfication of web content scalable and trustworthy.

**For more detailed information on how we want to accomplish this,** [check out our roadmap](https://github.com/WorldBrain/VISION-ROADMAP-FEATURES/blob/master/README.md).

<br>
### The first step towards this vision: *WorldBrain Webmarks*

*WorldBrain Webmarks* is an open souce web research tool for science communicators like science journalists, skeptics and scientists. It aims to make the 2 main elements of online research more efficient: **Content Discovery and Knowledge Management**

#### Key Features
 - Automatically retrieving related content for articles, blog posts and scientific papers from a **personal/science community-trusted** network of blogs, news outlets, facebook groups/pages and scholarly(PubMed) or governmental(FDA) databases.
 - Performing individual searches through all of those sources at once, instead of searching every page manually or the whole web via google. 
 - Bookmarking, annotating, sharing and discussing web content with the community and the public. 
 - Possibility for developers and data journalists/scientists to add new ways of putting web content into context, for example by displaying Altmetric data or scholarly citations.

However, the goal of this tool is to build a community of scientifically literate individuals to gather important meta data about the quality of web content and (in the long term) to ultimately train algorithms to detect various arguments in web content. ([What data will we gather from users?](http://www.worldbrain.io/open_and_social/))

In a second stage, we then apply those algorithms on a larger amount of web content allows creating a list of the most influential arguments. These can then be verified with crowdsourced templates ([Demo](http://arguments.worldbrain.io/?p=326)) that we can link back to the exact location where they appear. This can potentially lay the foundation for a large scale verification of web content.

## Current Status of Development

We just published our first proof of concept with the channel "Related Content" which is powered by [Laterals News API](https://lateral.io/publishing) and is broadcasted into a [Hypothes.is group](https://hypothes.is/groups/KG9bL1Bm/related-articles).

**[>> Check out the working demo and the near term development roadmap](https://github.com/WorldBrain/Webmarks/blob/master/README.md)**

Currently we are working on the feature of retrieving relevant content from a **science community-trusted** network of blogs, news outlets, facebook groups/pages and scholarly(PubMed) or governmental(FDA) databases.
