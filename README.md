Welcome to the WorldBrain project and great that you are also interested in improving the quality of humanity's greatest invention, the internet. :tada: :+1:

Together we want to work on the goal of **Increased (scientific) literacy in our global society through a better information quality on the internet.**

<br>

## Latest Development News

To stay updated about WorldBrain's progress, check out our 2-3 minute sprint report video and the extended blog post, we publish every 2nd Wednesday [on our blog](www.worldbrain.io/blog/).

#### Latest
We just published our first prototype with the channel "Related Content" , powered by [Laterals News API](https://lateral.io/publishing) and broadcasted into a [Hypothes.is group](https://hypothes.is/groups/KG9bL1Bm/related-articles).

#### Next Step
Currently we are working on the feature to search through the content of outlets (i.e. blogs, news, facebook groups/pages, scholarly and governmental databases) that have been **flagged as trustworthy by our science community**

## Vision of the WorldBrain project

In 10 years, we want to be able to provide the general public with a browser plugin that shows the accuracy and trustworthiness of web content, based on how well it represents scientifically verifiable facts. 
We follow an ambitious long-term goal, yet we are able to deliver immediate value to users and contribute to scientific literacy in the public at each step of our path.

**For more detailed information on how we want to accomplish this,** [check out our 10 year roadmap](https://github.com/WorldBrain/START-HERE/blob/master/ROADMAPS.md#worldbrains-10-year-roadmap).

### The first step: *WorldBrain Webmarks*

This is why, in a first step, we build Webmarks; an open-source SaaS tool for science communicator like scientists, science writer and the skeptical communities to find quality scientific web content faster.
The strategic purpose of Webmarks is to build a large community of scientifically literate individuals and be an integral part of their day-to-day online web research.

By analysing our user’s workflows, users already contribute at this stage with important metadata about the quality of different websites and their content.  ([What data will we gather from users?](http://www.worldbrain.io/open_and_socia

#### The user’s problem:
For people doing web research, it is a very time consuming process to find quality scientific content related to the immediate (news)article or their overall web research goal. 

To get this information, users currently have to search through all of their trusted outlets (i.e. blogs, news, facebook groups/pages, scholarly and governmental databases) separately or use google, where they are unable to filter for their trusted sources. 

#### Webmarks’ key features:
 - A search engine in the form of browser-sidebar, that lets users perform keyword searches through a list of outlets flagged by the user and/or our scientific community as trustworthy.
 - A recommendation engine to get related content to the immediate article, also only from these trusted sources, displayed in the sidebar. 
 - Additional meta browsing channels to put the immediate content into other contexts. For example by displaying Altmetric data in the sidebar or highlighting Wikipedia entries in the text.
 There are endless opportunities to do this and we surely won’t cover all of them. That is why we open up this platform to developers and organisations to add new channels and distribute them to users.
