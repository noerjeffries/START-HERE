# Development Roadmap

## Next Milestones

#### [Search Engine Prototype](https://github.com/WorldBrain/Webmarks/milestones/Search%20Prototype) (Due by July 17, 2016)

A simple google-like landingpage to enter search queries and get search result from a list of sources trusted by the scientific community. 


#### [Planning Freeze for MVP Features and Architecture](https://github.com/WorldBrain/Webmarks/milestones/Planning%20Freeze%20for%20MVP) (Due by July 23, 2016)
We want to have evaluated our options to build the prototype and planned the necessary features, so we can start the development on our **Minimum Viable Product**(MVP)

#### [Release Minimum Viable Product](https://github.com/WorldBrain/Webmarks/milestones/Minimum%20Viable%20Product) (Due date to be planned)
The release of the product that encapsules the set of features necessary, so we can call Webmarks a product.

## Feature Roadmap

#### Short Term (~3-6 months)

 - A search engine in the form of browser-sidebar, that lets users perform keyword searches through a list of outlets flagged by our scientific community as trustworthy.
 - A recommendation engine to get related content to the immediate article, also only from these trusted sources, displayed in the sidebar.

#### Medium Term (~6-12 months)

 - Additional meta browsing channels to put the immediate content into other contexts. For example by displaying Altmetric data in the sidebar or highlighting Wikipedia entries in the text. 
 - Personalisation of the choice of sources to get relevant content from and to search through.

#### Long Term (~1-1,5 years)

 - Opening up the meta browsing platform to developers and organisations to add new channels and distribute them to users.
 - (Maybe) Personal bookmarking, annotating, sharing and discussing of web content.

A search engine in the form of browser-sidebar, that lets users perform keyword searches through a list of outlets flagged by the user and/or our scientific community as trustworthy.
A recommendation engine to get related content to the immediate article, also only from these trusted sources, displayed in the sidebar.
There are endless opportunities to do this and we surely wonâ€™t cover all of them. That is why we open up this platform to developers and organisations to add new channels and distribute them to users.
